let shoesReviews = ["Received the shoes today and the seem to be comfortable so far. But why are the laces the length of kids laces? A mens size 8.5 and the laces barely tie. I have to order laces to be able to tie them securely. You’d think for $110 they wouldn’t skimp on the laces.","My son loved designing his own shoe and was really happy with the way it came out. His only issue was the creases on the left shoe. He's always been extremely careful to prevent creases in his Air Forces so he was disappointed to see them already in his new shoe! I hope they hold up as well as the regular ones. Overall, he loves it though.","One of the excellent versions to wear I use it to go to work and very comfortable","Great, stylish shoe that goes with any outfit. Hard to get in popular sizes, but if you check every morning when you wake up, you will eventually get a pair.","The ones made in India is just uncomfortable to wear. Not the same quality as the made in Vietnam I had before. Edges are rough, I have several pressure points in my feet. The tongue digs into my feet and the inside also. Waste of money"]
